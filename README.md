# The Gat-AR Tour - xzaviard.github.io
Hi, welcome to our Hack Solstice submission. We have created an online and in-person augmented reality tour, Gat-AR, for students to safely explore
and learn new things about the University of Florida. 

Check out our Youtube video as a demo: https://youtu.be/LTWJeRq7FN8

API Key for echoAR to view our holograms: jolly-bush-9124
Here is our website to view the online tour: https://xzaviard.github.io/

A project powered by echoAR and inspired by the F Book.
